### Welcome to my blog post! 
Today I'll talk about a few of my _favorite_ places I have visited so far in **2021**. 

Places that I've visited:

* Vancouver, Canada
* Miami, Florida
* Orlando, Florida
* Yellowston National Park, Wyoming
* Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming
* Boston, Massachussetts 
* New Orleans

I enjoyed [Yellowstone](https://www.nps.gov/yell/index.htm) and [Grand Teton National Park](https://www.nps.gov/grte/index.htm) the most, the scenery was beautiful! Check out their website by clicking on the names. 

Here's a picture so you can the beauty for yourself!
